Homage to the Buddha. The first volume. [Historical Introduction.]

1. In the year of the horse the ruler (btsan po) Khri lde Sroṅ btsan was staying in the palace
’On caṅ do1 in sKyi. The old war-lords of Higher and Lower Tibet, as well as the “robbers”2
were vanquished, and he received obeisance from Gar log through an envoy. The great ministers
Źaṅ khri Zur ram Śag and Maṅ rje lHa lod, these and others brought tribute from the
territories. Camels, horses and oxen in huge numbers were offered to the King, and each
and every man was recompensed with gifts from the main (źaṅ) minister and downwards.

2. [The King] requested the preceptors from the west, Ācārya Jinamitra, Surendrabodhi, Śīlendrabodhi,
Dānaśīla, Bodhimitra, and the Tibetan preceptors Ratnarakṣita, Dharmatāśīla, as
well as the learned translators Jñānasena, Jayarakṣita, Mañjuśrīvarman, Ratnendraśīla and
others to translate from Indic languages into Tibetan the terminologies of the Great and the
Small Vehicles, to define the terms, and make a written word list.

3. The decree was issued that “One shall never deviate from this list and make it suitable for
everybody to learn.”

4. Earlier, in the time of Father [king Khri sroṅ lde btsan] of the Divine Son [viz., the present
monarch, Khri lde sroṅ btsan], Ācārya Bodhisattva, Ye śes dBaṅ po, Źaṅ rgyal ñen Ña
bzaṅ, Blon khri gźer Saṅ śi, the translator Jñānadevakoṣa, lCe khyi ’Brug, and the brāhmaṇa
Ananta and others, since the Dharma-language was not known in Tibet, coined many terms;
some of these were not in accordance with the Dharma-texts and the principles of grammatical
theory (vyākaraṇa), and for this reason [it is now prescribed that] the improper [terms]
not [well] formed were to be revised.

5. So analysing which were deemed the most important terms of the [dharma-]language, they augmented
[the Tibetan vocabulary] and brought the terms into agreement with how they occur
in the texts of the Great and the Small Vehicle, how they are explained by the masters of
old like Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu, and how they accord with the principles in the works on
grammatical theory. As for the difficult cases, they analysed the words into their individual
parts, provided reasoned explanations, and finally wrote [the results of their efforts]
down as an authoritative document.

6. On the one hand, simple words that need no explanation and that are appropriate to be translated
literally (sgra bzhin du) have been fixed taking the literal expression as the main
criterion.

7. Whereas on the other hand, [in the case of] certain words, which are most appropriately fixed
in accordance with the meaning, the [equivalent] term has been fixed taking the meaning
as the main criterion.

8. Then, the great scholar dPal gyi Yon tan, the great scholar Tiṅ ṅe ’dzin and all the others
assembled before His Majesty, and after they had respectfully addressed the assembly of
Lords and Ministers, they codified the methods of translating the Dharma, as well as the
fixed terms in the Tibetan language in reference to the Indian language. Then the following
decree was pronounced:

9. “Regarding the way of translating the True Dharma, do not contradict the meaning, and adhere
to good Tibetan usage.

10. Regarding the translation of the Dharma, when a translation into Tibetan that does not deviate
from the word order of the Indian original [retains] the connection between the meaning
and words and is good usage, one should translate without deviating.”3

11. If one has to deviate [from the original word order] to produce good usage and intelligibility,
one can deviate and translate in a pleasing manner, but only within a single stanza.
As far as the meter is concerned, it should consist of four lines, or six if required.

12. In prose, as long as one arrives at the required meaning, one may deviate [from the original
word order] for the sake of good usage while taking both the words and meaning into consideration,
and one should translate [accordingly].

13. When it is possible to interpret one [equivocal] word [in Indian] with many [Tibetan] words,
one should strive, in the definition, to make [the translation] agree with the [context,
namely the words which come] before and after.

14. As in the word gautamya, from the sound gau one attains a number of entities: “speech”,
“geographic area”, “earth”, “light”, “vajra”, “bull”, “heaven”, etc.; and when one interprets
a word like kauśika sound-wise as “having to do with kuśa-grass”, “learned”, “liking lotuses”,
“owl”, “equipped with a treasure”, and so on, in the process of translating you attain
a multiple list [of Tibetan words].

15. As it is not possible to unite that multiple list [of meanings] into one [Tibetan word-]form
in the process of translation, one has to decide for one [equivalent].

16. But if there is no major reason [to choose any of the possible Tibetan equivalents], one
may leave the Indian [term] untranslated, and use the Indian word.

17. But wherever there is a [Tibetan] expression with a suitable [equivocal] interpretation,
you should render it in accordance with its general [and equivocal sense], and not translate
[with a generally employed Tibetan expression], deciding for only one direction [of meaning].

18. If one translates names of countries, living beings, flowers, trees, and so on, and the
possible translations are counter-intuitive, not good usage, imprecise, and as such the object
of doubt: “Should they really be like this or not,” – which should be avoided – then
one may keep the Indian term and preface it with a single Tibetan word “country” or “flower”
and so on as applicable to that [case as a classifier] – whatever [class of things] the
word [in question] refers to.

19. When it concerns numbers, if one translates according to the Indian language, one will have
“Monk-hundreds, thirteen less a half [hundred = 1250]”, but if one translates in accordance
with the ordinary Tibetan language “thousand two-hundred and fifty”, it is not in disaccord
with the meaning, and it is also in accordance with good Tibetan usage – thus suitable
summing numbers should be established in accordance with the principles of the Tibetan
language.

20. If one translates the prefixes pari, sam, upa and the others, which also may have the function
of ornaments, the method should be to construe them in accordance with the meaning
and translate them in accordance with its [Indian] word, [so as to produce in Tibetan] yoṅs
su, yaṅ dag pa and ñe ba. If no additional meaning is attained, it is not necessary to multiply
the construction [of the translated term], one should establish the word in accordance
with the meaning.

21. As for words that belong to a list [of related term or synonyms], if the word in question
is not closely related, one should establish an [equivalent] term which is a general word
in Tibetan and in accordance with good usage. If it is closely related [as a synonym of
other terms in the list] one should employ the [one Tibetan] term which designate each [of
the Indian synonyms].

22. Concerning the degrees of respectful expressions, and expressions relating to a particular
status, as concerned with the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas or the Śrāvakas: One should translate
[employing] the respectful expressions as related to the Buddha,

23. while in other cases, when concerned with the middle and lower forms [of respectful expressions],
one should translate in accordance with the principles codified by the translations
of the Dharma [scriptures] of the Ratnamegha and the Laṅkāvatāra as made earlier by the
learned scholars and analysts assembled before the Father of the Divine Son [that is, the
now ruling monarch].

24. Thus it is not granted to anybody individually to construct and after that establish new
words which are differing from the principles of language as decreed in this way. However,
if there is a need to construct and establish new words in individual schools, then, in
the individual schools, one may construct words without establishing them, and state the causes
of their origin in accordance with the dharma-books and the principles of word-[formation],
and one should investigate how to establish them in accordance with the dharma. Then
one should offer them to assembly in charge of the traditions of the Lord 4 in the Palace
and to the school of the great revisers of the dharma-translations, make a proper request,
and if accepted it is to be added to the word-list [of the Mahāvyutpatti].

25. The Tantras with their mantras are to be kept secret in accordance with the scriptures themselves,
and it is not proper that they are explained and taught to those not worthy. However,
in the meantime they have been translated and given for practice, but their concealed
meanings were not the subject of an oral explanation, thus [the words] were understood
literally – and false practices have originated. While it is an established fact that selections
from among the Mantra-Tantras and translations into Tibetan do exist, henceforth, with
regard to dhāraṇīmantras and the Tantras, it has been decreed that unless permission is
granted to translate [a specific such scripture], it is not allowed to collect or translate
the Mantra-Tantras and the words of the mantras.

26. The terms of the [Tibetan] language were not codified before, so since the terms were not
fixed in the lexicon, one has adhered to what is derived from the books of the Great and
the Small Way as well as books on language when explaining. Now the first part is ended.
